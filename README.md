# Finance Tracker

## About
I decided to create a **Finance Tracker** as a first-year student who has no idea how to manage my money. I have a lot of student loans, scholarship money, and monthly costs, and I have no idea if I am mismanaging my funds. The project would be used by people in similar situations trying to visualize their wealth as numbers on 10 different screens are hard to interpret and a hassle to check constantly. The user can create an account, which I can save along with their data so it can be pulled whenever the user decides to reopen the application. The tracker will help students, including me, to effectively and mindfully organize our debts to alleviate future stresses.

The finance tracker specifically will start off by collecting your data about sources of income, student loans, and savings and storing it in your account. From there, you will be able to ask what your net worth is to keep track of how rich or in debt you are. However, you will be able to create monthly budgets to prevent overspending and sensibly spend your hard-earned money. A quick feature that I might include is that if you go under your budget, you can either set the extra funds to go into savings or into next month's funds. Lastly, it will provide a fun tool that showcases the amount of money that could be made from creating a savings account or investing in index funds, promoting safe investments.
